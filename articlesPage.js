<h1>What Should I Eat Before a Run, and How Much?</h1>

<p>
    The answer depends on the kind of run you have planned,
    according to Kacie Vavrek, RD, a board-certified
    specialist in sports dietetics and an outpatient
    dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical
    Center in Columbus. If you’re planning on a run that
    lasts for an hour or longer, it’s helpful to have a
    pre-workout snack that you tolerate well. That choice is
    highly individual, she adds, and it takes some
    experimentation to figure out what works for you.
</p>

<p>
    In general, a snack that has a blend of lean protein and
    carbohydrates tends to be best, adds Hopkinsville,
    Kentucky–based dietitian Elizabeth Ray, RDN. For
    example, a small amount of skinless grilled chicken
    paired with a serving of sweet potatoes. Other options
    include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Banana or apple with nut butter</li>
    <li>
        Toast with half an avocado and a tablespoon of
        honey
    </li>
    <li>Small bowl of oatmeal and berries</li>
    <li>Bagel with nut butter</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Too much protein, like a whole chicken breast or more,
    usually isn’t advisable since it requires longer to
    digest when combined with carbs, per research. This
    means energy isn’t as readily available to your body as
    the energy you get from quick-digesting carbs.
</p>

<p>
    Generally, says Vavrek, a snack with quick-digesting
    carbs like a banana or a bagel works well, provided you
    had a regular meal about four hours beforehand. If
    you’re running first thing in the morning, just the
    snack is probably enough.
</p>

<p>
    “It really is variable, because some people can eat a
    huge meal right before a run and they’re fine, while
    others definitely can’t do that,” she adds. “Keeping a
    log of what you eat and how you felt on your run is the
    best way to figure it out for yourself.”
</p>

<h2>Is Carb Loading Still a Thing? Should I Consider It?</h2>

<p>
    The theory behind loading up on carbs is that they fill
    the body with energy so you can maximize your
    performance, usually about 12 hours before a big run.
    For example, some runners swear by eating pasta the
    night before a race and may eat more white bread, rice,
    and starchy foods the week leading up to the race, says
    Ray.
</p>

<p>
    “The theory of carb loading sounds delicious and
    seemingly makes sense,” she notes. “However, when too
    many carbs are eaten at one time, it’s hard on the body.
    You’ll see inflammation, poor digestion, energy slumps,
    and mood swings as a result.”
</p>

<p>
    Research has shown that carb loading may delay fatigue
    and improve performance by 2 to 3 percent during
    endurance events lasting longer than 90 minutes.
    However, after analyzing 24 randomized, controlled
    trials, the authors of a review in the Journal of the
    International Society of Sports Nutrition concluded that
    there isn't enough data to support the perks of carb
    loading in most people besides the male endurance
    cyclists studied.
</p>

<p>
    Instead of carb loading, Ray suggests focusing on
    balanced meals made of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
    Balanced meals do more for your energy levels than a
    huge bowl of pasta, says Ray.
</p>

<p>
    It’s also important to include sufficient carbs in your
    meals to maintain muscle glycogen stores (glycogen is
    the stored form of carbohydrates). Running requires
    plenty of glycogen. If you don’t have enough, your
    running performance and recovery may suffer, according
    to a review.
</p>

<p>
    Your carbohydrate requirements may vary, but aim for
    carbs to make up about 50 to 70 percent of your daily
    calories, per the Cleveland Clinic.
</p>

<h2>
    Do I Need to Fuel Up During a Run? If So, When and With
    What Foods?
</h2>

<p>
    Much like eating before you run, this depends on how
    long you’re running. If it’s under an hour, you’re
    unlikely to need a boost, Ray says. But on longer runs,
    carbs and electrolytes are recommended for every hour of
    the run.
</p>

<p>
    Not surprisingly, the most popular during-run options
    tend to be the easiest to carry while you’re running and
    should give you about 30 to 60 grams of quickly
    digestible carbs, says Vavrek. These include sports gels
    or gummy snacks, which can increase the amount of
    glycogen in your muscles.
</p>

<p>
    Glycogen (think of it as your body’s fuel tank) gets
    depleted at about 90 minutes of moderate to vigorous
    exercise, Vavrek says. A snack of quick-digesting carbs
    can help you avoid this so you finish strong, per
    Houston Methodist.
</p>

<h2>What About After a Run?</h2>

<p>
    As with any workout, eating after a run helps recovery.
    But Ray says there’s still debate about when it’s best
    to eat once you’re finished. Some runners do well having
    a protein-packed meal within an hour after an intense
    run, while others do better with a snack similar to
    pre-run choices, like a banana and nut butter.
</p>

<p>
    “Even if you have gels or other carb sources during a
    run, your glycogen will still be depleted when you
    finish,” adds Vavrek. “Because of that, incorporate some
    carbs. But you can also bring in more protein at this
    point (about 20 to 30 grams), along with more fluids and
    electrolytes.”
</p>

<h2>What About Hydration?</h2>

<p>
    There’s no debate here: Hydration is incredibly
    important. Ray says that having a handheld water bottle
    or hydration pack can be just as essential as running
    shoes. That will allow you to sip water throughout your
    run — no matter how long it is — to replace what you’re
    losing through sweat.
</p>

<p>
    Because that sweat contains minerals — mainly sodium and
    chloride, per the American Council on Exercise — you
    need to replace those as well, and that’s where the
    electrolytes come into play. Plenty of electrolyte
    powders and tablets on the market dissolve in water, but
    you can also make your own by adding some sea salt and
    coconut water to your water bottle, says Ray.
</p>

<p>
    However, not every run warrants an electrolyte beverage.
    Research shows that you may sweat enough during an
    intense workout lasting an hour or longer, making it a
    good time to sip an electrolyte drink. But for shorter,
    less intense workouts, water should be sufficient.
</p>

<h2>
    What’s the Most Common Misstep People Make When Fueling
    for Running?
</h2>

<p>
    If you’re using running or any form of exercise to lose
    weight, that can put you at risk of not eating enough
    calories, says Vavrek. While it seems to make sense
    mathematically if you’re relying on the “calories in,
    calories out” model, it’s not ideal for training because
    you need those calories for energy during a run and
    muscle repair afterward, she says.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, a study published in August 2023 in The Journal
    of Physiology found that restricting calories by 50
    percent for just 10 days reduced muscle protein
    synthesis (the process of creating new muscle proteins)
    in female athletes undergoing a combined resistance
    training and cardiovascular training program.
</p>

<p>
    “Cutting calories while trying to train is the biggest
    misstep because you’re basically sabotaging yourself,”
    she notes. “It’s more important to get what you need so
    your body can perform well, and that means eating the
    right foods, but it also means eating enough of them.”

<p class="author">By Sarah Garone</p>
<h1>You may think of ketchup as a humble-but-tasty topping on french fries, burgers, or hot dogs.</h1>

<p>
    But ketchup marketers are proposing a new use for the condiment: running fuel. A recent ad on
    YouTube from Heinz, claims individual packets of the tomato spread could be an easy, inexpensive
    mid-run snack.
</p>

<p>
    The online chatter about ketchup as running fuel has been around for awhile. Reddit threads
    (from 2021) have previously posed the question of ketchup packets as substitutes for pricey
    running gels.
</p>

<p>
    Heinz’s recent commercial claims: “Runners everywhere are using Heinz ketchup on their runs.”
    The brand has even created pre-set routes on which runners can stop in at restaurants that carry
    Heinz ketchup packets to refuel.
</p>

<p>
    Routes have been mapped in major cities across the United States and Canada and are available in
    running apps like MapMyRun and Strava. Online advocates of the ketchup-as-running-fuel idea
    claim that the carbohydrates in ketchup can keep distance athletes going strong — there are
    about 2 grams (g) per 9g Heinz packet.
</p>

<p>
    While the idea of stashing a few free packets of ketchup from a fast-food restaurant instead of
    shelling out cash for specially formulated energy gels sounds promising, take pause. Experts say
    runners can skip this trend.
</p>

<h2>What a Sports Dietitian Says About Using Ketchup to Fuel Long Runs</h2>

<p>
    Long-distance runners require refueling mid-race, and carbohydrates are the best source of
    energy during exercise.
</p>

<p>
    Per a joint statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Dietitians of Canada, and
    the American College of Sports Medicine, during exercise longer than 60 minutes, athletes should
    consume 30 to 60 g of carbohydrates per hour.
</p>

<p>
    For longer races, such as marathons or triathlons, carb needs increase, says Honolulu-based
    sports dietitian Katie Schimmelpfennig, RD, founder of Eat Swim Win, who works with competitive
    endurance runners in her practice. During athletic activities that last 2.5 hours or longer, she
    recommends 60 to 90 g of carbohydrates per hour.
</p>

<p>
    Here’s why ketchup is probably not the best way to get those carbs, according to her and other
    experts.
</p>

<h2>You’re Going to Have to Eat a Lot of Ketchup if You Use It as Running Fuel</h2>

<p>
    Ketchup packets may contain carbohydrates, but you’d have to eat a lot of them to attain the 30-
    to 60-gram hourly mark necessary for a long run. “The main drawback of using ketchup as a
    running fuel is that it simply doesn’t have enough carbs,” says Seattle-based sports dietitian
    Steph Magill, RD, who is a fellow of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “It’s not realistic
    for a runner to consume the number of packets needed to come close to matching what they need to
    replace their energy needs.” (For reference, you’d need to consume 15 packets with 2 g of
    carbohydrates each to reach the 30-gram mark.)
</p>

<p>
    For longer runs or races, the number of required packets goes even higher. It would take a
    whopping 30 packets of Heinz ketchup to consume 60 g of carbs. Unless you really, really love
    ketchup, that’s probably more than you want to eat — or carry on your person while jogging.
</p>

<h2>That’s a Lot of Sodium, Too</h2>

<p>Magill points out that ketchup packets have some other notable nutrition drawbacks.</p>

<p>
    Those packets contain 90 milligrams (mg) of sodium each. Consuming 15 packets on a long run
    means that the runner is going to get much more sodium than they need, she says.
</p>

<p>
    The Daily Value of sodium (the amount recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
    consume and not exceed daily) for adults is 2,300 mg per day.
</p>

<p>
    Because runners lose sodium through sweat, they do need to replenish these losses (particularly
    when running long distances or sweating a lot, as in humid weather) — but not necessarily to the
    extent that dozens of ketchup packets provide. According to a study published in 2022, endurance
    athletes should consume 300 to 600 mg of sodium per hour during exercise. Fifteen packets
    provide significantly more than that at 1,350 mg of sodium, or 59 percent of the Daily Value.
</p>

<p>
    And although ketchup provides electrolytes in the form of sodium, it doesn’t balance this out
    with other important minerals.
</p>

<p>
    “Ketchup lacks other electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium,” Schimmelpfennig
    says. These nutrients help keep blood pressure at a healthy range, per research published in
    2019. You can find an ideal blend of sodium and other electrolytes in specially formulated
    sports beverages and gels.
</p>

<h2>And That’s a Lot of Acidity</h2>

<p>It’s also possible that ketchup’s high acidity level could cause gastrointestinal (GI) distress.</p>

<p>
    Ketchup has a pH level of about 3.6 (research has found), making it an acidic food. Acidic foods
    can irritate the lining of the stomach and duodenum, causing pain or upset stomach. High-acid
    foods are also notorious triggers for acid reflux. And according to research published in 2016,
    running causes the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, allowing more stomach acid to wash up
    into the esophagus. Ketchup might further aggravate the problem.
</p>

<p>
    “Acidity could be a factor for some athletes, especially at the volume required to meet energy
    needs,” says Magill. “I’d expect there could be some GI upset with that volume of ketchup being
    consumed.”
</p>

<p>
    If you’re an athlete who’s already susceptible to stomach issues like diarrhea and cramping on
    long runs, it’s probably not worth adding a potential GI disruptor into the mix.
</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line: Why Experts Say Save the Ketchup for Post-Running</h2>

<p>
    Ultimately, though ketchup packets may come in small, totable packaging and contain a few carbs
    and sodium, that’s where their advantages for runners end.
</p>

<p>
    “Bottom line is ketchup doesn’t have a place as a running gel. People should stick to foods that
    are high in carbohydrates and low in fiber, fat, and protein so that they can be easily digested
    and used by the body for fuel,” says Magill.
</p>

<p>
    Rather than stopping in at a fast food restaurant for packets of ketchup, she recommends trying
    foods like dried fruit, crackers, bananas, or granola bars.

<h1>
Tired of feeling stiff, sore, or tight? Stretching — a type of exercise that improves
flexibility and mobility by lengthening your muscles, via extension or movement — may help.
</h1>

<p>
In fact, stretching is a must, not just for athletes but for anyone who wants to feel good
(read: less pain) in life. According to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), everyone
should stretch at least two to three times per week, and establishing a daily stretching habit
is most effective.
</p>

<p>
“The goal of stretching is to decrease tension and improve flexibility in your muscles to
improve the range of motion of our joints,” says Daniel Giordano, DPT, CSCS, a physical
therapist at Bespoke Treatments in New York City. Making stretching a staple in your health and
fitness routine then, in turn, promotes longevity, helps prevent injury, improves the experience
of aging, and more.
</p>

<p>
But stretching isn’t just about bending over to touch your toes. There are several stretching
methods, and each has slightly different effects and benefits. Moreover, certain stretching
types are better performed before a workout than after — and vice versa.
</p>

<h2>How Passive Stretching and Active Stretching Differ</h2>

<p>
The various stretching methods can be categorized in a number of ways. However, it may be
easiest to break them into two main buckets: passive and active.
</p>

<p>
According to a research review, passive stretching is any technique in which the lengthened
muscle doesn’t contract (tighten or shorten), while active stretching involves muscle
contraction at some point during the stretch.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, active stretching methods are ideal for preparing your muscles for exercise,
whereas passive stretching methods are best saved for after your workout, says Frederick E.
Soliman, DO, a primary care sports medicine physician and researcher at Orlando Health Jewett
Orthopedic Institute in Orlando, Florida, and head primary care sports physician for the
University of Central Florida.
</p>

<p>Now, let’s dig into the different stretching types and their benefits.</p>

<h2>Types of Passive Stretching</h2>

<h3>Static Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> This is the most common type of stretching, according to the
American Council on Exercise (ACE). “Static stretching involves holding the stretch at its end
range for a period of time, usually 30 seconds to two minutes,” says Giordano. A classic example
of a static stretch is the hamstring stretch.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> Place one leg on a low stool with your hips and feet facing forward.
Then, lean forward from your hips until you feel a stretch in the back of your thigh. Make sure
to keep your back flat and knee straight throughout the stretch, per the Hospital for Special
Surgery (HSS).
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> Static stretching can improve flexibility and decrease tension when
performed as part of a post-exercise cooldown, Giordano notes. It can also increase range of
motion. In fact, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in January 2021 in
Sports Medicine, static stretching not only increases range of motion in the stretched muscle or
joint, but it also improves range of motion in muscles or joints that aren’t being stretched.
</p>

<h3>Passive Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> Passive stretching is similar to static stretching in that it calls
for holding a stretch at its end range for 30 seconds to two minutes. The difference is that
passive stretching involves applying an external force — like a towel, resistance band, gravity,
or another person — to improve flexibility and range of motion, Giordano says. The external
force supports you during the stretch, whereas with static stretching, you have to support
yourself in the position of the stretch.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> Take the static hamstring stretch above: To make it passive, you’d lie
on your back, lift one leg until you felt a stretch in your hamstrings, and recruit a partner to
hold your lifted leg in place.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> Like static stretching, passive stretching is ideal for cooling down
after a workout. Passive stretching increases blood flow to muscles, which helps clear waste
products like lactic acid, says Dr. Soliman. ”That can help with muscle recovery,” he adds.
</p>

<h2>Types of Active Stretching</h2>

<h3>Active Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> This method of stretching involves contracting one group of muscles
while the opposite group of muscles are stretched. These types of stretches are typically held
for 10 to 15 seconds and without using an external aid, notes Christynne Helfrich, PT, DPT, an
orthopedic clinical specialist with Hinge Health, a digital joint and muscle care clinic. “An
example would be using your back muscles to open your arms and chest really wide to feel a
stretch on the front part of your pectoral and chest muscles,” Helfrich says.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> Stand straight with both feet flat on the floor. Spread your arms wide,
parallel to the floor, and gently lean back until you feel a stretch across the front of your
chest.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> Active stretching helps elongate the target muscles, increase blood
flow, and get your joints moving. “So it’s really warming up the muscles to prepare them for
activity,” Soliman says. It also improves mobility and decreases pain or soreness, Dr. Helfrich
notes.
</p>

<h3>Isometric Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> “This form of stretching occurs when the muscle that is being
stretched is contracted in a static position,” Helfrich says. Essentially, you’ll take a static
or active stretch and add an isometric muscle contraction — this is where the muscle doesn’t
change length (visibly move). “An example would be when you’re stretching your quad,” says
Helfrich.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> While standing, bend one knee to bring your ankle close to your glutes.
Firmly hold your ankle in place and try to straighten your knee against the resistance of your
hand.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> This type of stretching improves your range of motion and strengthens
your muscles at their end range of motion, “which is typically where they are the weakest,”
Helfrich says. This perk makes isometric stretching helpful for injury prevention, she adds.
</p>

<h3>Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF)</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> PNF, which stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, is
typically performed with the help of a practitioner, Giordano says. It alternates between
contracting and relaxing a muscle to deepen range of motion, per ACE. And there are several
different types of PNF, including “contract relax,” “hold relax,” and “contract-relax agonist
contract,” according to a research paper. While these types differ slightly, they’re generally
performed by contracting the stretched muscle at 75 to 100 percent of its maximum, holding for
10 seconds, and then relaxing, the paper notes.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> Per ACE, a hamstring stretch using the PNF “hold-relax” method would
look like this: Lie on your back and have someone lift one leg toward the ceiling until you feel
a stretch in the back of your lifted leg. Hold there for 10 seconds. Hold and contract your
hamstring for six seconds while the other person applies force. Relax and hold the stretch for
30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> PNF is used in therapeutic and athletic settings to rehabilitate
injuries, improve performance, increase strength, and encourage full range of motion, according
to a research paper. It’s thought that resisting force while stretching, and then relaxing into
a passive stretch before repeating the contraction sends signals from the nervous system that
tell the muscles it’s safe to stretch further, the paper explains. The contraction builds
strength, while achieving a deeper stretch improves flexibility and range of motion.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> Dynamic stretching involves actively tightening your muscles and
moving your joints through their full range of motion, per the HSS. Whereas static stretches are
meant to be held for a length of time, dynamic stretches aim to get the body moving. “It’s a way
to warm-up the muscle and prepare it for exercise,” Soliman says.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> Walking lunges, leg swings (standing on one leg and swinging the other
in front of and behind you through the full range of motion), and torso twists (moving your
torso from one side to other without moving your feet or legs) are a few examples of dynamic
stretches, per the HSS.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> According to the HSS, dynamic stretches are functional and
sport-specific movements that boost muscle temperature and reduce stiffness, which may improve
speed, agility, and acceleration in your chosen activity. In fact, several studies have found
short-term increases in power, sprint, or jump performance after athletes performed dynamic
stretches, according to a research review.
</p>

<h2>Other Types of Stretching</h2>

<h3>Somatic Stretching</h3>

<p>
<strong>What It Is:</strong> Even if you’ve never heard of somatic stretching, you’ve likely
come across it in commonly associated forms of exercise, such as yoga, pilates, qigong, the
Feldenkrais Method, and tai chi.
</p>

<p>
Somatic stretching differs from other stretching methods in that it doesn’t have a set protocol;
you don’t have to target specific muscle groups or hold a stretch for a preestablished length of
time. Instead, you release muscular tension by performing gentle movements and staying aware of
your body and any sensations that come, Soliman says.
</p>

<p>
For example, you can arch your back and stretch. As you do, notice where you feel tension and
adjust your movements. You can also raise your arms overhead, twist your torso from side to
side, or round forward. Because somatic stretching doesn’t require muscle contractions, it may
qualify as either passive or active stretching.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Try It:</strong> This total-body stretch practice, per Johns Hopkins Medicine’s YouTube
channel, uses a mix of held stretches and slow, fluid movements to bring mobility and
flexibility to the body.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> Studies in somatic stretching are lacking. However, this stretching
method may improve your mind-body connection, “which can allow people to be more in tune with
their body and move in ways their body craves,” Helfrich says. And by using slow, controlled
movements combined with deep breathing, you may experience reduced muscle tension and pain,
improved blood flow to the muscles, and a more relaxed state of mind.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
All told, no matter how you stretch, it’s important you do. Not only does regular stretching
improve your flexibility and mobility, it can also help you prevent injury, prepare for and
recover after workouts, age well, and combat stiff, sore, or tense muscles from everyday life.

        Sore muscles are one of the less pleasant side effects of exercise. Depending on the type and
        intensity of the workout, muscle soreness after a workout can range from barely noticeable to
        extremely painful.
        </h1>
        <h2>Why Do Our Muscles Get Sore in the First Place?</h2>

        <p>
            Muscle soreness after exercise (also referred to as delayed-onset muscle soreness, or DOMS)
            signals that you caused damage to your muscle tissue, according to the American College of
            Sports Medicine (ACSM). When this damage, or micro-tearing, happens, your body initiates the
            repair process by triggering inflammation at the injured site, says Shawn Arent, PhD, CSCS, a
            professor and the chair in the department of exercise science at the University of South
            Carolina in Columbia and the director of its sports science lab.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fluid accumulates in the muscles, putting extra pressure on the damaged areas, leading to that
            familiar sensation of tightness and pain that typically begins to develop 12 to 24 hours after
            your workout, Dr. Arent says.
        </p>

        <p>
            While you create a little bit of damage every time you exercise, certain types of workouts are
            notorious for higher levels of damage and — by extension — soreness. In particular, any workout
            that’s new to you, more intense than usual, or involves a lot of eccentric movements will likely
            cause more damage and muscle soreness than other types of workouts.
